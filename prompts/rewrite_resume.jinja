You are an expert resume‐tuning assistant.

Extracted facts from the user’s resume:
{% for key, value in facts_json.items() %}
• **{{ key|capitalize }}**: {{ value }}
{% endfor %}

Original resume text:
{{ resume }}

Target job description:
{{ job_desc }}

Now rewrite the resume as a set of bullet points that:
- Integrate the extracted facts
- Tailor each point to highlight fit for the job description
- Are concise, achievement‑oriented, and action‑driven
